## Configuration - [up](#table-of-contents)

The following configuration works regardless of whether you are using `$HOME/.tmux.conf`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf`.
To enable plugins set up the `@dracula-plugins` option in your `.tmux.conf` file, separate plugin by space.
The order that you define the plugins will be the order on the status bar left to right.
The name of the plugin used in the [table of contents](#table-of-contents), as well as each plugins headline, is the name to be used in the `@dracula-plugins` option.

```bash
set -g @dracula-plugins "cpu-usage gpu-usage ram-usage"
```

For each plugin is possible to customize background and foreground colors.
For more fine-grained color customization please reference [Color theming](/docs/color_theming/README.md).

```bash
# per default available colors: white, gray, dark_gray, light_purple, dark_purple, cyan, green, orange, red, pink, yellow
# set -g @dracula-[plugin-name]-colors "[background] [foreground]"
set -g @dracula-cpu-usage-colors "pink dark_gray"
```

## Status bar options - [up](#table-of-contents)

Enable window flags

```bash
set -g @dracula-show-flags true
```

Adjust the refresh rate for the status bar

```bash
# the default is 5, it can accept any number
set -g @dracula-refresh-rate 5
```

Enable high contrast pane border

```bash
set -g @dracula-border-contrast true
```

Hide empty plugins

```bash
set -g @dracula-show-empty-plugins false
```

Set plugin padding
Whilst the padding is one space per default, can be whatever you want it to be, whether that's whitespace or other characters.
**If you want to remove any padding, you need to use a zero width space!**

```bash
set -g @dracula-left-pad ' ° '
set -g @dracula-right-pad ' ° '
# no padding with zero width space
set -g @dracula-left-pad '​'
set -g @dracula-right-pad '​'
```

### Powerline - [up](#table-of-contents)

Enable powerline symbols

```bash
set -g @dracula-show-powerline true
```

Enable edge icons

```bash
set -g @dracula-show-edge-icons true
```

Switch powerline symbols

```bash
# for left
set -g @dracula-show-left-sep 

# for right symbol (can set any symbol you like as separator)
set -g @dracula-show-right-sep 
```

Make the powerline background transparent

```bash
set -g @dracula-transparent-powerline-bg true

# the left separator symbol is inversed with a transparent background, you can modify it with any symbol you like
set -g @dracula-inverse-divider 
```

### Left Icon - [up](#table-of-contents)

- The left icon can be set to anything static you'd like.
- However if you use tmux on multiple machines, it may be helpful to display the hostname.
- If you use multiple sessions simultaneously it can be good to name them and have the name in the left icon.

the following example uses formatting to display `"hostname | session_name"`:

```bash
set -g @dracula-show-left-icon "#h | #S"
```

formats:

```bash
#H: Hostname of local host
#h: Hostname of local host (no domain name)
#S: name of session -> suggestion: alias trs to tmux rename-session
#W: current Window
```

more formats can be found here, though those without a shorthand like #H need to be used like #{host}, which is equivalent.
[reference: tmux(1) - OpenBSD manual pages](https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1#FORMATS)

besides formats, any other string can be used.

additionally the left icons padding can be set like so:

```bash
# default is 1, it can accept any number and 0 disables padding.
set -g @dracula-left-icon-padding 1
```

## [Color Theming](/docs/color_theming/README.md) - [up](#table-of-contents)

Each individual widget's foreground and background color can be overridden.
Additionally, the variables used for storing color values can be overridden and extended.
This allows for the use of custom themes like catppuccin or gruvbox.

For everything regarding colors, please refer to [the color theming directory](/docs/color_theming/README.md).

## Plugins

### attached-clients - [up](#table-of-contents)

This widget provides the number of clients attached to the current tmux session.

Set the minimum number of clients to show (otherwise, show nothing)

```bash
set -g @dracula-clients-minimum 1
```

Set the label when there is one client, or more than one client

```bash
set -g @dracula-clients-singular client
set -g @dracula-clients-plural clients
```

### battery - [up](#table-of-contents)

This widget provides information about the current charge of the battery, whether it is attached to a powersupply and charging from it, or running off the powersupply without charging. it also detects desktop pcs having no battery.

Display any icon for the battery you'd like with:

```bash
set -g @dracula-battery-label "♥ "
```

to use nothing but nerdfont icons informing you about the current state, use the following,
which will display the battery charge and whether its charging (or just drawing from AC) as nerdfont icons.

```bash
set -g @dracula-battery-label false
set -g @dracula-show-battery-status true
```
these settings will introduce the following icons:
- the battery is discharging and at the current level: `󰂎` `󰁺` `󰁻` `󰁼` `󰁽` `󰁾` `󰁿` `󰂀` `󰂁` `󰂂` `󰁹`
- the battery is charging and at the current level: `󰢟` `󰢜` `󰂆` `󰂇` `󰂈` `󰢝` `󰂉` `󰢞` `󰂊` `󰂋` `󰂅`
- power is being drawn from AC, but the battery is neither charging nor discharging: ``
- we were able to determine that the battery is charging/ discharging, but something about the percentage went wrong: `󰂃`
- we don't know the status of the battery: ``



if you have no battery and would like the widget to hide in that case, set the following:

```bash
set -g @dracula-no-battery-label false
```

alternatively, if you have no battery and would like a nerdfont icon to indicate that, consider setting the following:

```bash
set -g @dracula-no-battery-label " "
```

in case you have multiple batteries:

the default battery label is only displayed in the very front.
you can specify multiple battery labels by splitting them with `\n` like so:
```bash
set -g @dracula-battery-label "1:\n2:"
```
additionally you can specify the separator between each battery like so:
```bash
set -g @dracula-battery-separator "; "
```

### compact-alt - [up](#table-of-contents)

This widget allows the user to switch to an alternate list of widgets when the terminal becomes narrow.
Switching only works if the widget is added to `set -g @dracula-plugins "your-plugins-here"`.

to set what widgets should be shown in narrow mode, set the following variable. _make sure to include the compact-alt widget as you won't be able to switch out of narrow mode otherwise._

```bash
set -g @dracula-narrow-plugins "compact-alt battery network weather"
```

to determine when to switch to narrow mode, set the following variable.
any value below this threshold is considered narrow.

```bash
set -g @dracula-compact-min-width 140
```

the compact-alt widget needs to reload your tmux config to switch from wide to narrow and back.
therefore, you need to make sure to set the right path to your config file.

```bash
set -g @dracula-config-path "$HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf"
```

if you want to see your window with and whether narrow mode is active, set the following, which is false per default.

```bash
set -g @dracula-compact-alt-verbose true
```

this widget maintains a global variable informing about whether narrow mode is active.
that variable should never be touched by the user and could potentially be used by other widgets/ plugins.

```bash
# NEVER DO:
set -g @dracula-narrow-mode some-value
```

### continuum - [up](#table-of-contents)

```bash
set -g @dracula-continuum-mode countdown
```
